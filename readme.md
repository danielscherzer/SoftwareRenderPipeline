# About
This is software implementation of the real-time rendering pipeline. This software is not optimized for speed, but for easy to understand code for teaching purposes.


# Todo
1. Render 2 instances of the `suzanne` model next to each other (translation)
1. Implement switching on/off of the ZTest (`RenderState.ZTest`).
1. Implement blending (`RenderState.Blending`).
1. Implement back face culling and add a `RenderState.Culling` flag.
1. What would you need to implement texturing?
